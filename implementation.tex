\subsection{Encoder} 
For the transmitting end of the system, we implement a UHD application to generate the signal. It takes a given bit stream, and produces encoded frames following a predefined bit-to-symbol mapping and the frame layout described in the previous subsection. We use 1 MHz sampling rate and a given transmitting frame rate to generate samples within one frame. These samples are then encoded with bit 1s and 0s with the corresponding symbol frequency.
The frames are then turned into analong signal and transmitted via LED light.

\subsection{Decoder} 

The decoder is implemented in several programming languages. Two are implemented in Matlab and C++ with OpenCV for post processing and analyzing. 
The other is implemented in Objective-C with OpenCV as an iOS application for real-time processing. We will evaluate the processing time in \autoref{sec:ios_eval}.
